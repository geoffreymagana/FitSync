# FitSync Super Admin & Microservices Architecture

This document outlines a high-level strategy for evolving the FitSync platform into a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS application managed by a Super Admin dashboard. This architecture is designed to support robust monitoring, feature management, and tenant administration.

---

## 1. Microservices Architecture Vision

As FitSync grows, a microservices architecture will be crucial for scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of services. The monolithic application would be broken down into the following logical, independently deployable services:

-   **Authentication Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Manages user sign-up, sign-in, password resets, and multi-factor authentication. Issues JWTs with user roles and `tenantId`.
    -   **Technology**: Firebase Authentication, or a dedicated OAuth 2.0 provider like Auth0/Okta.

-   **Tenant Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Manages tenant information (e.g., `mygym.fitsync.com`), subscription plans (Starter, Pro, Enterprise), custom domains, and tenant-specific configurations (branding, enabled features).
    -   **Database**: Firestore `tenants` collection.

-   **Membership Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Manages member profiles, trainer assignments, and staff information within a specific tenant.
    -   **Database**: Firestore, with all collections nested under `/tenants/{tenantId}/`.

-   **Scheduling Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Handles creation, booking, and management of classes and appointments. Manages instructor schedules and recurring events.

-   **Payments Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Integrates with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Paystack) to process membership subscriptions and POS transactions. Manages invoices and billing history.
    -   **Note**: This service would be highly secure and PCI compliant.

-   **Check-In & POS Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Manages real-time member check-ins and processes walk-in sales (POS).

-   **Notifications Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Handles the dispatch of emails, SMS, and push notifications for events like class reminders, payment failures, and new messages.

-   **Analytics Service**:
    -   **Responsibilities**: Aggregates data from other services into a data warehouse for generating business intelligence reports. This service would power the tenant-facing analytics dashboard.

## 2. Super Admin Dashboard

The Super Admin dashboard is the central control panel for the FitSync team to manage the entire SaaS platform. It would be a separate Next.js application with its own secure authentication.

### 2.1. Key Dashboard Modules

#### A. Platform Health Monitoring
This dashboard provides a real-time overview of the entire system's health.

-   **Service Status**: Displays the operational status (Up, Down, Degraded) of each microservice, pulled from a health-check endpoint on each service.
-   **Error Rate Monitoring**: Integrates with a logging service (like Sentry, Datadog) to display real-time error rates, showing spikes that could indicate a failing service.
-   **API Latency**: Shows P95/P99 latency for critical API endpoints across services, helping to identify performance bottlenecks.
-   **Database Performance**: Monitors Firestore read/write rates and latencies.

#### B. Business & Product Intelligence
This module provides insights into the overall health of the FitSync business.

-   **SaaS Metrics**:
    -   **MRR/ARR**: Monthly and Annual Recurring Revenue.
    -   **Churn Rate**: Percentage of tenants who cancel their subscriptions.
    -   **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: The total revenue a tenant is expected to generate.
    -   **Active Tenants**: Number of tenants actively using the platform.
-   **Usage Metrics**: Tracks key feature adoption across all tenants (e.g., total classes booked, number of members managed, POS transactions processed). This helps the product team understand which features are most valuable.

#### C. Tenant Management
A CRM-like interface for managing all tenants.

-   **Tenant List**: A searchable and filterable list of all tenants.
-   **Tenant Detail View**:
    -   View tenant-specific information (domain, admin contact).
    -   Manually change a tenant's subscription plan (e.g., upgrade from Pro to Enterprise).
    -   View a tenant's billing history and payment status.
    -   **Impersonation**: A "Log in as Admin" feature for troubleshooting tenant-specific issues.

#### D. Feature Flag Management
This system provides granular control over feature availability for different tenants.

-   **Implementation**: Can be built using **Firebase Remote Config** or a dedicated service like LaunchDarkly.
-   **UI**:
    -   A list of all feature flags in the system (e.g., `enable_advanced_analytics`, `allow_custom_branding`, `enable_sms_notifications`).
    -   For each flag, the Super Admin can define **rules** and **segments**.
        -   **Global Rollout**: Enable a feature for all tenants.
        -   **Percentage Rollout**: Enable a feature for a random X% of tenants to test its impact.
        -   **Per-Tenant Enablement**: Enable a feature only for specific `tenantId`s.
        -   **Plan-Based Rollout**: Automatically enable a feature for all tenants on a specific plan (e.g., "Enterprise" plan gets `allow_custom_branding`).
-   **Adoption Tracking**: The dashboard would show what percentage of tenants have a specific feature enabled and how many are actively using it.

#### E. Platform-Wide Payment Processing
A central view to monitor all financial transactions across the platform.

-   **Transaction Feed**: Real-time feed of all payments processed by the Payments Service.
-   **Gateway Health**: Monitors the status of the connection to the payment gateway (e.g., Stripe API status).
-   **Dispute Management**: An interface to view and manage chargebacks and payment disputes.
-   **Revenue Analytics**: High-level charts showing revenue by plan, by region, etc.
