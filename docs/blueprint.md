## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Red (#E50914) to reflect energy and fitness. The association of the color red with the prompt content makes it a fitting selection.
- Background color: Desaturated red (#F2E0E1), for a light scheme
- Accent color: Gold (#D4AF37), as it's analogous to red and contrasts well, conveying a sense of quality and luxury.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of text, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body, giving a bold, clean look.
- Cards with sharp corners (6px border-radius) and buttons with flat edges for a modern, sharp design.
- Use a set of minimalist icons representing different fitness activities.
- Subtle transitions and animations for dashboard cards and check-in confirmations.
